#  WIP: KHexagon Library

## Overview

KHexagon is a Kotlin library designed to assist with the mathematical manipulation and geometric visualization of
hexagonal grids. Whether you're developing a board game or a hexagonal tile-based simulation, KHexagon provides a
foundational toolset to streamline the grid calculation and representation processes.

The library offers comprehensive functionality for operations in a hexagonal grid context including, but not limited to:

- Generating lines and shapes like circles or rings on a hexagonal grid.
- Calculating distances between points.
- Providing support for different types of hexagonal layouts (like pointy-top, flat-top, offset, and doubled grids).

## Getting Started

### Installation

To include KHexagon in your Kotlin/Java project, add the following dependency to your Gradle build file:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("io.github.offlinebrain:khexagon:$version")
}
```
